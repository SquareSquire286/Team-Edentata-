# Our Motivation
Current exposure therapy techniques, especially for arachnophobia pose danger with unpredictability of spider behaviour. Virtual reality exposure therapy is one step safer, however interactions the user has are often only passive. These things, coupled with the increasing demand and shortage of therapists available make exposure therapy less accessible than necessary. ArachnoTherapy VR is an application created to improve accessibility and efficacy of current exposure therapy techniques by allowing for level-based progression and guidance from a virtual therapist.

# Codebase
All scripts can be found in the [Scripts](Scripts/) section. 
_Note: Version control through Unity was done using PlasticSCM therefore all regular changes were uploaded [here](https://www.plasticscm.com/orgs/ense_400_477_capstone/repos/ENSE-477-Capstone/changesets) with periodic updates to Github. Unity project specific files such as assets and materials, and game engine configurations will not be reflected in Github due to the nature of the project._
